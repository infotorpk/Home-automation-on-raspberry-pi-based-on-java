Home-automation-on-raspberry-pi-based-on-java
=============================================
Raspberry Pi home automation system that will switch your home appliances on or off .If we are moving towards a smart home 
it requires a serious investment of money for hardware,but if we have a little power house computer like raspberry  pi its 
getting easier. Here we are creating one toggle button which is intended to control  the Raspberry Pi GPIO.
Then we are connecting an relay one end to Pi GPIO and another one end to home appliance(here I am using BULB).
